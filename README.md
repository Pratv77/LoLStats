NOTE: API KEY NEEDS TO BE UPDATED
# LoLStats

Welcome to LoLStats, an interactive web application dedicated to helping League of Legends players track and analyze their in-game performance. LoLStats utilizes the Riot API to provide a comprehensive collection of detailed match statistics and player data.

**Note: This is an older personal project that I created to learn about web development and using API's. So, some features may no longer work as intended due to updates in web technologies or changes to the API. Keep in mind that this project represents my early learning stage and definitely does not adhere to all current best practices for responsive design or code optimization.**
